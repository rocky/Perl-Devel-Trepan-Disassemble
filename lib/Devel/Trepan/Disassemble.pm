=for comment
This file is shared by both Disassemble.pod and Disassemble.pm after
its __END__
Disassemble.pod is useful in the Github wiki:
https://github.com/rocky/Perl-Devel-Trepan-Disassemble/wiki
where we can immediately see the results and others can contribute.

=for comment
The version Disassemble.pm however is what is seen at
https://metacpan.org/module/Devel::Trepan::Disassemble and when folks
download this file.

=head1 NAME

Perl Disassembly plugin for L<Devel::Trepan> via L<B::Concise>

=head1 SUMMARY

This adds a I<disassemble> command to the L<Devel::Trepan> debugger.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<disassemble> [I<options>] [I<subroutine>|I<package-name> ...]

I<options>:

    -concise
    -terse
    -linenoise
    -debug
    -compact
    -exec
    -tree
    -loose
    -vt
    -ascii
    -from <line-number>
    -to <line-number>

Use L<B::Concise> to disassemble a list of subroutines or a packages.  If
no subroutine or package is specified, use the subroutine where the
program is currently stopped.

Flags C<-from> and C<-to> respectively exclude lines less than or
greater that the supplied line number. Other flags are are the
corresponding I<B::Concise> flags and that should be consulted for
their meaning.

=head1 EXAMPLES

  $ trepan.pl -e 1

  (trepanpl): dissassemble
  Package Main
    main program:
  =>  LISTOP (0xa0dd208)
    	op_next		0
    	op_sibling	0
    	op_ppaddr	PL_ppaddr[OP_LEAVE]
    	op_type		185
    	op_flags	0001101: parenthesized, want kids, want void
    	op_private	64	
    	op_first	0xa0e6f60
    	op_last		0xa0e7298
    OP (0xa0e6f60)
    	op_next		0xa0dd228
    	op_sibling	0xa0dd228
    	op_ppaddr	PL_ppaddr[OP_ENTER]
    	op_type		184
    	op_flags	0000000
    	op_private	0	
    # 1: 1
    COP (0xa0dd228)
    	op_next		0xa0dd208
    	op_sibling	0xa0e7298
    	op_ppaddr	PL_ppaddr[OP_DBSTATE]
    	op_type		182
    	op_flags	0000001: want void
    	op_private	0	256
    OP (0xa0e7298)
    	op_next		0xa0dd208
    	op_sibling	0
    	op_ppaddr	PL_ppaddr[OP_NULL]
    	op_type		0
    	op_flags	0000001: want void
    	op_private	0	

Above, the C<=E<gt>> indicates the next instruction to run. 

By default I<disasm> is an alias for I<disassemble>. Here is the
C<-tree> option; C<--tree> is okay too.

   (trepanpl): disasm -tree

    main program:
    0xa0dd208-+-0xa0e6f60
              |-# 1:  1
    0xa0dd228
              `-0xa0e7298

Functions can be given:

   (trepanpl): disasm -basic File::Basename::basename

    File::Basename::basename:
    UNOP (0x8ad1d00)
    	op_next		0
    	op_sibling	0
    	op_ppaddr	PL_ppaddr[OP_LEAVESUB]
    	op_type		174
    ...

Finally, you can limit the range of output using C<-from> and/or C<-to>: 

   (trepanpl): disasm -from 227 -to 236 -basic File::Basename::basename
